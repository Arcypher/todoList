# todoList
This is a todo list built on HTML, CSS, and JS.
The purpose is to practice building a project without
using any JS frameworks except Node.js to create a
server, and Express.js for templating.

DESIGN:
- There will be a title named 'todo.'
- There will be a input field to enter in text.

LOGIC:
- A user will be able to click on the input field.
- A user will be able to enter a task into the field.
- The field will then append a todo beneth it.
- The todos will have the most recent value go to the bottom.
- There is an info bar at the bottom with options of 'all',
    'Active', and 'Completed.
- Clear completed will get rid of anything completed.
- There is an arrow on the field that will appear when there is
    at least one todo.
- clicking the arrow will make everything complete.
- Double clicking a todo will let a user edit the text.
- hovering over a todo will have a 'x' icon to appear
- hovering over the 'x' will make it more saturated.
- There will be a message saying "# items left" if there
    is something in the list.
- Clicking the circle will bring a checkmark, crossout the
    todo, set to "complete" and subtract number of items.
